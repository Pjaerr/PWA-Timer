# PWA-Timer
A Progressive Web App implementation of a stopwatch with set interval reminders.

Similar to my other repo 'Productivity Timer', this is a tiny project aimed at delving more in what PWAs are, how they work and how they deal with serving the entire functionality offline as well notification control of a web app as if it were native.

In terms of the app, it will give you a timer, you can run the timer, pause the timer or reset the timer. When the timer reaches a given interval (say 2 hours), it will notify you, and then count to that interval again. So you would get a reminder at 2:00:00, but also at 4:00:00. I am making this to learn, but to also allow me to track my time spent working, whilst also being reminded to take breaks when I have been working for a set amount of time.
